# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the app’s branding to “MD SUHEL”, apply a blue background theme, and add a header logo.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace existing global branding text with “MD SUHEL” in the header, footer copyright line, and the HTML document title.
- Apply a blue background theme across main app pages while keeping text, cards, borders, and interactive elements readable and visually consistent.
- Add a static generated logo image in the header, displayed alongside the “MD SUHEL” site name, with responsive alignment/sizing.

**User-visible outcome:** The app shows “MD SUHEL” branding throughout, uses a clearly blue page background with legible content, and displays a logo next to the site name in the header on both mobile and desktop.
